# About üìö A Book Place App ‚ú® 
**A Book Place** is a place for book enthusiasts to store information about the books they have read. A user can login add to their list of books, edit the status of a book, and leave notes on the book. A user can also check what other users in the community are reading and see what they said about their books. 

## Why This App?
I love books and wanted to create a place where I could catalog the books I have read. I also wanted to have a community aspect to the app so that others can join and add their books and we can all be inspired my each others libraries!
